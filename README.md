# NextJS practice

## Answer 1
Basic array manipulation in JS.

Given an array of integers, keep a total score based on the following:
1. Add 1 point for every even number in the array
2. Add 3 points for every odd number in the array, except for the number "5"
3. Add 5 points every time the number "5" appears in the array

Note that 0 is considered even.

Examples:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 13 Input: [17,19,21]
Output: 9 Input: [5,5,5]
Output: 15

    - Pure CSS, no CSS framework
    - CSS animations
    - Some degree of responsive design. (Desktop and Mobile)
    - With NextJS,they support server-side rendering by default which is good for SEO.
